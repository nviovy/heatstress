# Code for heatstress paper
This repository contains the code used in the paper "Heat stress: an underestimated impact of climate change on vegetation"

1. **ORCHIDEE_heats.tz** contains in a tarball the ORCHIDEE code based on tag 2.2 including the new parameterization of heatstress turnover
2. **CodeC** is a directory than contains the different C codes used to estimate delta Hs_ref, the heatstress indice, from the different remote sensing data (MODIS and COPERNICUS LAI, Ts and different vegetation indices)
3. **R code figures** is a directory that contains both data and R scripts used to generate the figures from the paper
